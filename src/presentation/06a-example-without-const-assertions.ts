}

// A lot to worry about and maintain:
// - Need a new type for every variant, or you need to deal with complex generics to get it working?
// - Lots of new type names, and naming things is hard.
// - What properties belong on the base vs each variant?
// - No type inference for the other properties, so you need to handle those specially
// - Make sure that the properties are correct for each variant, or use a generic utility type to keep them aligned
// - Even after all of this, your types are only as narrow as you explicitly define, never as narrow (and thus never as safe) as the literal.
