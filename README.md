# Lunch & Learn - TypeScript

Let's learn together about some of TypeScripts more intermediate->advanced features that can be extremely useful day-to-day.  This talk will include some prime examples of places in upcoming projects that could benefit from some of these strategies, such as the upcoming Wagmi Chains refactor.

- Type casts - their various shapes/forms, and why they're dangerous 
- "as const" - how are const assertions different than casts?
- "satisfies" - enforcing vs applying types
- narrowing
- zod
- ...and more!
